# Overview

The whole chess game will be represented by a bunch of classes:

- The board (with 64 squares/locations in an 8x8 grid)

- The Chess pieces. Each player controls 16 pieces (one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.)

- Two players (who manipulate chess pieces on the board)

The game ends when a player checkmates the opponents king. The game could also end in a draw

## Rules

- Each player controls a set of 16 pieces. Each of the sets are referred to as black and white
